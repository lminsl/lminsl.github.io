I'm a mathematics student at Princeton University, currently building at Aleph Lab (YC F25).

My work sits at the intersection of pure mathematics and applied problem-solving. As an International Mathematical Olympiad silver medalist and top-20 Putnam competitor, I've spent years developing intuition for mathematical elegance. This experience informs my problem writing for competitions including MOMO and Korea Winter Program, where I create questions that challenge competitors to find deeper structure.

## Recognition

My research has been recognized with dual Samsung Humantech Gold Prizes for work in percolation theory and graph games. I've also competed in the Korean Undergraduate Mathematics Competition (Grand Prize, 2023) and received Princeton's Class of 1861 Prize for outstanding Putnam performance.

## Achievements

- **International Mathematical Olympiad** - Silver Medal (2020)
- **Romanian Master of Mathematics** - Silver Medal (2019)
- **William Lowell Putnam Competition** - 18th place out of 2,975 participants (2022)
- **Korean Undergraduate Mathematics Competition** - Grand Prize (2023)
- **Class of 1861 Prize** - Princeton Mathematics Department
- **Samsung Humantech Paper Award** - Gold Prize (2x) for research in percolation theory and graph games

## Currently

I'm exploring opportunities in quantitative trading, technology, and entrepreneurship — particularly problems that combine mathematical rigor with real-world impact.
