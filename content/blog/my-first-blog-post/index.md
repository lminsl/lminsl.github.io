This is a test post to verify the Obsidian to Hugo sync workflow.

## Why I'm Writing This

I want to share some thoughts from my notes. For example, I've been thinking about ideas from [[reads/Zero to One, Peter Thiel|Zero to One]] lately.

Also, check out my [[writings/writings/C. aging/Note 240710 -- 요즘 가장 많이 말하는 고민|recent reflections]] on language and career.

## What's Next

- Build the sync script
- Test with more posts
- Deploy to lminsl.github.io

This post contains:
- A heading
- Wikilinks with aliases
- Korean text in links
- A simple list
