This is a test post to verify the Obsidian to Hugo sync workflow.

## Why I'm Writing This

I want to share some thoughts from my notes. For example, I've been thinking about ideas from Zero to One lately.

Also, check out my recent reflections on language and career.

## What's Next

- Build the sync script
- Test with more posts
- Deploy to lminsl.github.io

Here's a test image:
