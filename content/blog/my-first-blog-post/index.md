This is a test post to verify the Obsidian to Hugo sync workflow.

## Why I'm Writing This

I want to share some thoughts from my notes. For example, I've been thinking about ideas from [Zero to One](/blog/zero-to-one-peter-thiel/) lately.

Also, check out my [recent reflections](/blog/note-240710-요즘-가장-많이-말하는-고민/) on language and career.

## What's Next

- Build the sync script
- Test with more posts
- Deploy to lminsl.github.io

This post contains:
- A heading
- Wikilinks with aliases
- Korean text in links
- A simple list
