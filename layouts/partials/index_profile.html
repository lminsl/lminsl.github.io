        <div>
            I'm a sophomore at Princeton University, majoring in mathematics and minoring in computer science. My background as an International Mathematical Olympiad medalist has equipped me with a solid foundation in problem-solving and analytical thinking, which I continue to build on through my studies and experiences..
        </div>
        
        <div>    
            What drives me most is the pursuit of fresh, original ideas that can only emerge from deep, thoughtful exploration. I am passionate about solving complex problems that have the potential to make a meaningful impact on humanity. Equally important to me is the desire to uncover the beauty that exists within both nature and society. These values shape my approach to learning, problem-solving, and the opportunities I seek.

        <div>
            I'm actively exploring opportunities in quantitative trading, tech, and entrepreneurship, and I would love to learn more about these fields and connect with individuals or teams working on meaningful projects that "seek greatness". Please feel free to reach out if you have opportunities or insights to shareâ€”I'd be excited to connect!
