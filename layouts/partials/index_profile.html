            Hi! My name is Minjae, and I was previously an undergraduate student at Princeton,
            after which I took a leave of absence to serve at the Republic of Korea's Air Force. 
            I am expected to be discharged in July 2024 and will return to Princeton shortly after.

            My primary interests lie in Mathematics and Computer Science, particularly in the subfields of Combinatorics, Theoretical Computer Science, and Machine Learning. 
            Other interests include Cryptocurrency technologies and Quant Research.

            In the past, I participated at the IMO and was a math olympiad coach in Korea; here are some olympiad math resources written by me. 
            <br> Also alumni of Hanseung Sonjaehan Scholarship (2018-2020), Talent Award of Korea (대한민국인재상, 2020), and Korean Presidental Science Scholarship (2021).
