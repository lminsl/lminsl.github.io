        Thanks for visiting my webpage! My name is Minjae, and I was an undergraduate student at Princeton until 2022,
        after which I took a leave of absence to serve at the Republic of Korea's Air Force. 
        I am expected to be discharged in July 2024 and will return to Princeton shortly after.

        I was also an IMO medalist and a previous math olympiad coach; here are some olympiad math resources written by me.

        My primary interests are in mathematics and computer science, particularly in the subfields of combinatorics, theoretical computer science, and machine learning.
