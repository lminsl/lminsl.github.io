            <h3>Thanks for visiting my webpage! </h3> My name is Minjae, and I was an undergraduate student at Princeton until 2022,
            after which I took a leave of absence to serve at the Republic of Korea's Air Force. 
            I am expected to be discharged in July 2024 and will return to Princeton shortly after.
